For this challenge I have constructed a web page for my portfolio. 
I have included a header with my name and photo
My page has a navigation section that links to other sections of the page that displays my bio, my work and my contact information
The "My Work" section has boxes and flex boxes as place holders for future work to be added
The "Contact Info" section contains my phone number, email, github address and deployed page URL
